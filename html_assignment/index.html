    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is hichem, i'm 27 years old, and i'm <strong>Algerian</strong>, presently i'm living in canada as an international student at <emphasis>Algonquin college</emphasis>, and my program is <mark><abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr></mark>. I have chosen this program because i like photgraphy style and graphic design specialy anime and video game design.</p>
    <p>This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> year in Canada. Even if it is hard to be far from my family, I learned how to be more responsible and independent. Music and video games help me to forget the distance. I really like game and character design, And this is one of the reasons why I chose this program to follow my dream.</p>
